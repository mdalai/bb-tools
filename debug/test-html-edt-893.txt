<p><em><strong>What does every educator need to know about the brain?</strong></em> <strong>by Eric Jensen</strong><br /> Eric Jensen is a seminal figure in the area of brain-based learning (which is technically distinct from mind-brain education). This short video will introduce you to Eric Jensen and provide a few foundational brain-based ideas that Jensen considers important for educators.<br /> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/HyYhoCqo58w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyYhoCqo58w" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyYhoCqo58w</a></p>
<p><em><strong>Neuroplasticity and Education</strong></em><br /> For a long time, many people believed the brain to work like a machine, with each part playing distinct and unrelated roles. More recent research shows how resilient we are as humans, and how our brain can adapt and change through learning and new experiences. This short video introduces us to this idea called neuroplasticity, and why it is important for education.<br /> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ELpfYCZa87g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELpfYCZa87g" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELpfYCZa87g</a></p>
<p><em><strong>Mind, Brain and Education: The Impact of Educational Neuroscience on the Science of Teaching</strong></em> <strong>by David A. Sousa (pp. 37 – 43)</strong><br /> David Sousa is another seminal scholar in the field of mind-brain education. The following link is to a text with a collection of essays about the subject. However, pp. 37-43 provides a helpful summary and introduction for educators. <br /> <a href="http://www.learninglandscapes.ca/images/documents/ll-no9-final-lr-2.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.learninglandscapes.ca/images/documents/ll-no9-final-lr-2.pdf</a></p>
<p><em><strong>Brain Rules Schools: What School Would Look Like if we Listened to Research</strong></em><br /> Education can sometimes be shaped by trends and fads more than research. What would schools look like if we tried to build them based more upon the principles that we can extract from mind-brain research? This resource explores that question and offers some possibilities.  <br /> <a href="http://gettingsmart.com/2011/12/brain-rules-schools-what-school-would-look-like-if-listened-to-research/" target="_blank">http://gettingsmart.com/2011/12/brain-rules-schools-what-school-would-look-like-if-listened-to-research/</a></p>
<p><em><strong>Mind, Brain and Education Journal</strong></em><br /> This online journal includes a collection of some of the best and most current research in mind-brain education. Many of the articles can be viewed for free on the web site. For others, you can access them by using the CUW online library databases and your library card. <br /> <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1751-228X/issues" target="_blank">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1751-228X/issues</a></p>
<p><em><strong>Why Mind, Brain Education?</strong></em><br /> This article is named after the central question for the essay. Along the way, it provides a simple and straightforward rationale for the importance of mind-brain research in education.<br /> <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/j.1751-228X.2007.00006.x/" target="_blank">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/j.1751-228X.2007.00006.x/</a></p>
